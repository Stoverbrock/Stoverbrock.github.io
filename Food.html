				<h1 class="page-title">Frosted Mini Wheats</h1>
				<p>
					Frosted Mini wheats are an ancient American delicacy, the origins of which stem from the desire to unlock the hidden pleasure centers of the mind. Expand your conciousness by consuming this drug-like confection.

					We encourage you to read further from the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosted_Mini-Wheats">Holy Scripts</a>

				<h1 class="page-title">Candy Corn</h1>
				<p>
					<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_corn">Candy corn was first discovered by an unknown Israeli carpenter by the name of Jesus Christ. Upon consuming the flesh of this fruit he was endowed with special abilities, all of which may be obtained by simple consumption.</a>

				<h1 class ="page-title">Banana Chips</h1>
				<p>
					When <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_chip">banana chips</a> were first retreived from Mount Olympus by the Buddha, Allah responded in fury. Mortal souls were not to entwine themselves with the pleasures of the Heavenly realm. The destruction of Sodom and Ghamorrah ensued, but even Allah lacked the ability to purge this indulgence from the human world. Every day we continue to eat banana chips, and every day we spit in God's eye.
