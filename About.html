				<p>
					We charge approximately $30,000 a month to keep you up to date on society's highest culture. A donation of one's soul is also required to be a part of this process, and that is obtained through one's email address.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are interested in living your life to its full extent, please do not hesitate to give your life away for the cause of being considered to be amongst the elites.

					<h3>What We Do</h3>
					<p>We are dedicated to educating the masses on the ways of social elitism. To be cultured is to live a certain lifestyle, it is to be a certain kind of person. We aim to mold you into exactly this form of person.</p>
